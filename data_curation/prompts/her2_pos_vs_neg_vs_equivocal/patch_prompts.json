    "Positive": {
      "HER2 Overexpression": "Strong; complete membrane staining; indicative of HER2 positivity.",
      "High Tumor Cellularity": "Densely packed cells; high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio; scant stroma; 'blue' appearance from dense nuclear staining.",
      "Mitotic Figures": "Numerous in aggressive tumors; cells in division; high proliferation rate.",
      "Necrosis": "Dead cell areas; cell debris; lost tissue architecture; outpaced blood supply.",
      "Pleomorphism": "Variation in size and shape of cells and nuclei.",
      "High Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes Levels": "Inferred from H&E sections; small, round, darkly stained nuclei; scant cytoplasm.",
      "Dense Clustering": "Large, densely packed cellular areas on H&E; high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio; minimal stroma.",
